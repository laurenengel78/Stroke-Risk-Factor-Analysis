# Stroke-Risk-Factor-Analysis
This Jupyter Notebook uses Matplotlib and pandas to visualize and determine possible risk factors that increase the odds of a patient having a stroke. \
The dataset used in this notebook contains data from both patients who have had and who haven't had a stroke, and compares the attributes of these two categories to find which ones lead to a higher risk of stroke.

This project was created in Spring 2022 as a final project for CSC 223 at Kutztown University.
